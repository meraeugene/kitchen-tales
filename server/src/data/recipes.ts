    cooksTips:
      "For optimal egg fried rice, start with cold, day-old rice to prevent clumping during stir-frying. Prep all ingredients in advance, ensuring your wok or skillet is hot before adding cold oil. Scramble eggs quickly for a light texture, and season gradually with soy sauce, salt, and pepper, adjusting to taste. Stir-fry over high heat to achieve the characteristic smoky flavor, avoiding overcrowding the wok to ensure even cooking. Add cooked meats or tofu towards the end to keep them tender, and customize with flavors like garlic or ginger. Garnish with scallions or cilantro for freshness, and remember that experimentation is key to perfecting your personalized egg fried rice.      ",
